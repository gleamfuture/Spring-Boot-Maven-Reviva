We offer particle, diamond tip, and vibration microdermabrasion.<br/><br/>Particle microdermabrasion exfoliates skin by spraying particles of medical-grade baking soda crystals in a controlled steam. It also comes with a vacuum to clear up dead skin cells and crystals. Each step of the process is designed to optimize the skin’s health and appearance by increasing blood flow and collagen production.<br/><br/>The diamond tip has a crystal-free option which makes it impossible to leave behind tiny particles. This allow for precise treatment in small places and crevices such as areas close to the eyes, nose, and mouth. The tip also utilizes vacuum pressure which increases blood circulation in the underlying dermis. Here, the growth of new skin cells and the production of collagen/ elastin fibre are initiated to tone and firm the skin. Another effect of increased blood circulation is reduced puffiness around the eyes as excess fluids and toxins are drained from the face. <br/><br/>Vibraderm, getting its name from its function to vibrate, is the most efficient treatment for a full body exfoliation. This machine comes with a textured stainless-steel paddle that gently vibrates at high speeds as it moves across the skin to exfoliate. <br/><br/>Glowing and luminous skin can be achieved after uncovering the dead layers of the epidermis through these microdermabrasion treatments.",

          "what": "Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) is a treatment for killing acne activity. It is suitable for cases of mild to severe acne and acne scarring. During the treatment process, a photosensitizing agent called 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) is applied to the skin and becomes activated when put under a specific wavelength of light. Once activated, the ALA is absorbed by acne cells making acne more receptive to bacteria-killing light. Since ALA is hydrophilic, it requires a longer penetration period, thus requiring 1.5 days of avoiding sun exposure. <br/><br/>We offer a natural alternative by replacing the ALA solution with a solution composed of vitamins and amino acids. This natural solution penetrates faster with high efficacy while causing no harsh side effects. By using the natural photosensitizer, the activation and duration of post-treatment sun avoidance are both shortened.",

It speeds up the process of regenerating healthy and rejuvenated skin. This treatment is done by applying an acid to the problem area. The type of acid and it's strength which is depended on the skin condition. Chemical peels can be used on the face and many parts of the body. <br/><br/> We provide superficial and medium-depth chemical peels. Deep peels are replaced by lasers and other modern technologies. <br/><br/> We offer numerous chemical peels for different skin concerns:<ul><li>Trichloroacetic (TCA) peel (100% trichloroacetic acid)</li><li>Lactic peel (30% lactic acid)</li><li>Glycolic peel (20% glycolic acid)</li><li>Melanostop peel (6% phytic acid, 10% resorcinol, 20% azelaic acid)</li><li>Jessner peel (8% citric acid, 14% salicylic acid, 14% lactic acid)</li></ul>",

During the treatment process, a photosensitizing agent called 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) is applied to the skin and becomes activated when put under a specific wavelength of light. Once activated, the ALA is absorbed by acne cells making acne more receptive to bacteria-killing light. Since ALA is hydrophilic, it requires a longer penetration period, thus requiring 1.5 days of avoiding sun exposure. <br/><br/>We offer a natural alternative by replacing the ALA solution with a solution composed of vitamins and amino acids. This natural solution penetrates faster with high efficacy while causing no harsh side effects. By using the natural photosensitizer, the activation and duration of post-treatment sun avoidance are both shortened.",

It is designed to treat acne scars, large pores, sagging skin, and stretch marks.</p><h3>Scarlet RF</h3>Scarlet RF is different from other similar devices in that the needles are non-insulated.  The initial concern for non-insulated needles is the risk of superficial skin burn.  However, the design of Scarlet is so intelligent that not only superficial burn does not happen, the non-insulated needles are in fact advantageous to produce positive change to the entire skin layer.  The difference “inductance” of the different area of the skin allows the technology to be safely applied on skin. Our experience at Reviva has confirmed the tremendous safety of this particular device.</p><h3>So what is the result you can expect from Scarlet RF?</h3><p>At Reviva, where we have performed many hundred of Scarlet RF treatments, we have seen a diminishment in pore size, scar improvement, and skin brightening.  However,  the most pleasant effect we see is skin tightening  and sharpening of the lower half of the face so the face looks more oval in shape.  We have seen equal and at times even better result with Scarlet RF in skin tightening than focus ultrasound as well as no-needle RF devices. The needles ensure the energy is reliably deliver to the skin at the desired level.</p><h3>Scarlet RF and the new Scarlet-S</h3><p>Scarlet RF (and the new Scarlet-S) is a great tool we have at Reviva to combat the effect of skin aging, acne scar as well as general skin conditioning.   This is one of the devices we have full confidence to recommend to our patients because of the safety, efficacy and cost effectiveness.</p>",

The initial concern for non-insulated needles is the risk of superficial skin burn.  However, the design of Scarlet is so intelligent that not only superficial burn does not happen, the non-insulated needles are in fact advantageous to produce positive change to the entire skin layer.  The difference “inductance” of the different area of the skin allows the technology to be safely applied on skin. Our experience at Reviva has confirmed the tremendous safety of this particular device.</p><h3>So what is the result you can expect from Scarlet RF?</h3><p>At Reviva, where we have performed many hundred of Scarlet RF treatments, we have seen a diminishment in pore size, scar improvement, and skin brightening.  However,  the most pleasant effect we see is skin tightening  and sharpening of the lower half of the face so the face looks more oval in shape.  We have seen equal and at times even better result with Scarlet RF in skin tightening than focus ultrasound as well as no-needle RF devices. The needles ensure the energy is reliably deliver to the skin at the desired level.</p><h3>Scarlet RF and the new Scarlet-S</h3><p>Scarlet RF (and the new Scarlet-S) is a great tool we have at Reviva to combat the effect of skin aging, acne scar as well as general skin conditioning.   This is one of the devices we have full confidence to recommend to our patients because of the safety, efficacy and cost effectiveness.</p>",

          "what": "The TriPollar® RF is a toning device which tightens the skin and reduces cellulite. It is a painless treatment during which energy is delivered to the surface of the skin and to subcutaneous fat layers. This process accelerates fat metabolism and shrinks fat cells for a sculpted look that lasts. This not only reduces excess skin after fat-loss, but is also effective against stretch marks.<br/><br/><h3>What is the advantage of tripollar RF (radiofrequency) device over unipolar or bipolar devices?</h3>Unipolar devices delivers high power through the body, requiring a ground pad to complete the circuit.  It is a painful procedure. <br/><br/>Bipolar devices only allow the RF energy passes through the superficial part of the skin (1/2 distance between the electrodes) and does not give adequate tissue tightening because of limited depth penetration.<br/><br/>Tripollar RF by Pollagen delivers the energy through multiple electrodes which alternate in polarity.  It allows deeper penetration of the energy to the deeper fat and superficial fat layer with gentler power.  Yet the power density remains high enough to heat up the tissue.<br/><br/><h3>How does Tripollar RF work?</h3>As fat and skin has different resistance to RF energy,  Tripollar selectively heats the fat cells in the deep and superficial adipose layers simultaneously.  Heating the fat cells increases the metabolism and forces them to release/secrete fatty acids ( liquid fat) into the extracellular space and into the blood and lymph systems.<br/><br/><h3>What are the results of Tripollar treatment?</h3>One should see results in at least 4 areas:  Fat cell shrinkage, circumferential reduction, cellulite improvement, collagen renewal and skin tightening.",

          "what": "The TriPollar® RF is a toning device which tightens the skin and reduces cellulite. It is a painless treatment during which energy is delivered to the surface of the skin and to subcutaneous fat layers. This process accelerates fat metabolism and shrinks fat cells for a sculpted look that lasts. This not only reduces excess skin after fat-loss, but is also effective against stretch marks.<br/><br/><h3>What is the advantage of tripollar RF (radiofrequency) device over unipolar or bipolar devices?</h3>Unipolar devices delivers high power through the body, requiring a ground pad to complete the circuit.  It is a painful procedure. <br/><br/>Bipolar devices only allow the RF energy passes through the superficial part of the skin (1/2 distance between the electrodes) and does not give adequate tissue tightening because of limited depth penetration.<br/><br/>Tripollar RF by Pollagen delivers the energy through multiple electrodes which alternate in polarity.  It allows deeper penetration of the energy to the deeper fat and superficial fat layer with gentler power.  Yet the power density remains high enough to heat up the tissue.<br/><br/><h3>How does Tripollar RF work?</h3>As fat and skin has different resistance to RF energy,  Tripollar selectively heats the fat cells in the deep and superficial adipose layers simultaneously.  Heating the fat cells increases the metabolism and forces them to release/secrete fatty acids ( liquid fat) into the extracellular space and into the blood and lymph systems.<br/><br/><h3>What are the results of Tripollar treatment?</h3>One should see results in at least 4 areas:  Fat cell shrinkage, circumferential reduction, cellulite improvement, collagen renewal and skin tightening.",

The dilation makes them visible and they often appear on the legs, arms, and face. While some may consider them to be a cosmetic nuisance, spider veins are not painful nor are they a health risk.<br/><br/>What are Varicose Veins?<br/><br/>In varicose veins, the valves which prevent backflow of blood do not function properly, causing veins to bulge. Varicose veins are enlarged or twisted veins that are often found as projections on the legs. People who stand for prolonged periods of time or people who have leg injuries are more prone to varicose veins. Poor posture, obesity, pregnancy, menopause, and aging can also bring upon varicose veins. <br/><br/>How does sclerotherapy work?<br/><br/>Sclerotherapy is a medical procedure in which a sclerosant is injected into visible or raised veins. When injected, the agent will shrink and permanently obliterate the vein. We use Health-Canada-approved sclerosants called Sclerodex and Trombojects ® to treat veins. Sclerotherapy is more preferable than lasers for large veins as the latter can cause pain and pigmentation. However, lasers are useful for clearing up smaller veins left over from sclerotherapy treatment.",

This ensures a thorough treatment with less discomfort and more safety.<br/><br/>Cheveux Diode’s wavelength (810 nm) is ideal for permanent laser hair reduction and is safe for all skin tones. It's “Smooth Flow” technology allows the 810 nm wavelength to enter the hair follicles gradually and deeply where it is selectively absorbed by melanin. This process thermally destroys the hair follicle, leading to permanent hair reduction.<br/><br/>The HR mode on this laser is effective for treating the face and other small, delicate areas like the fingers and toes.",

          "what": "<p>Laser tattoo removal is a safe and effective way to selectively remove the pigment of tattoos with minimal disruption to surrounding skin. Different laser machines of different wavelengths are used to target tattoos of different colours.</p> <h3>Safety</h3> <p> Not all lasers are the same.  There are a few physical properties of a laser that make tattoo removal safer and effective.  The energy of the laser delivered, the proper parameters used,  the property of the light when interacting of the skin are crucial to achieve an optimal result for tattoo removal.  For example, too much energy will cause non-specific tissue damage and too little energy will lead to ineffective result.  A poor “beam profile’ causes an uneven energy distribution over the skin and can increase the chance of scarring.</p> <h3>Colored tattoos</h3> <p> You do need more than one laser with different light properties to remove different colours. For example, a green light laser will not be effective to remove a green colored tattoo.  You need a laser which emits a complementary colour, like red, to do that.  The new generation picosecond claims to overcome some of these limitation, but the result is not as good as it originally hope.</p> <h3>Pain</h3> <p> Pain is an issue in tattoo removal and is indeed a deterrent for people to come for treatment.  There are different ways to mitigate the pain.  If you do have a larger tattoo, the pain is significant.  It is better to remove it with better anesthesia which can be provided in a medical facility.</p>  <h3>Cost</h3>  The cost of treatment is always a factor.  People have the wrong impression the cost is prohibitive.  However, most people find the price is very reasonable after consultation at our clinic and they are surprised they pay even more in a non-medical facility.</p> <h3>Time</h3>  The process of tattoo removal is a very slow and arduous process.  Multiple treatments are needed.   It does take some time to remove a tattoo.</p> <h3>Laser choices</h3> <p>At Reviva, we do not have one, but 3 lasers, including a picosecond laser, dedicated for tattoo removal. We have performed thousands of tattoo removal and all procedures are performed by a physician who has more than 15 years of laser experience on different conditions.</p>",
